# installation instructions
This plugin is distributed as a firefox plugin.

Go to releases, and download the latest release (.zip)

Then, go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox

Click on load temporary add-on

Select the .zip you downloaded.

Then, go to bonk.io, and you should be good to go!

If you get "does not contain a valid manifest", then follow the following extra steps:

Extract all of the files from the .zip, then open the extracted folder, open the folder IT contains, and select all of the files, and create a NEW .zip just containing them. Firefox can get confused by the recursive folder structure of the release.
